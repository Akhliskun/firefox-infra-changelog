|6|rail|shipit/frontend: make ship_firefox_rc skippable (#1703)  Firefox RC has a special case, when we want to skip pushing the updates  to the beta channel and proceed with the release-only phases. In this  case we should be able to push to CDNs without requiring ship_firefox_rc  to be scheduled.|[URL](https://github.com/mozilla/release-services/commit/39aab8d39fdef891bbe4f0c3352a3ceac6637eb9)|2018-11-26 16:06:14

I also  regenerated the dependencies of the projects that switched to connexion  2.0.      shipit/api: Fix release sync, add dates (#1684)    Initially I didn't add the started/completed datetimes to the sync  functionality, probably because they are not exposed in the constructor.    Additionally I added an API endpoint to sync the datetimes only.      data not needed anymore      shipit/api: update release status (#1688)    In the future we will need to update the release status explicitly from  a in-tree scheduled task, so we mark a release as completed only after  all required tasks are done (bouncer, tests, etc).      shipit/frontent: add testing config (#1687)    At this point it is the same as staging.js      uplift/bot: Add a BUGZILLA_COMMENT_ONLY setting in order to report failed uplifts without cancelling requests.

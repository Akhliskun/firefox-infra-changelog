|20|Masayuki Nakano |Bug 1496288 - part 2: Stop dispatching non-printable "keypress" events, set keyCode or charCode value to the other value when it's zero, start to dispatch "keydown" and "keyup" events during composition, and enable window.event by default r=smaug  First one is for bug 968056.  UI Events declares that "keypress" events should be dispatched only when a key press produces one or more characters (and also discussing about Enter key press for backward compatibility).  Therefore, we should stop dispatching "keypress" events for non-printable keys (like arrow keys, Ctrl + A, etc) in the default group on content for conforming to UI Events, but keep dispatching them in chrome and in the system group on content.  Next one is for bug 1479964.  No spec declares that what value should be set to keyCode and charCode value of "keypress" events because declaring that would break existing web apps which handle them with UA string.  However, some web apps assume that if window.event is available, keyCode value of "keypress" event is set to a Unicode code point of inputting character.  We set only charCode to it, but the other browsers sets both keyCode and charCode to a Unicode code point of inputting character.  Therefore, we need to follow the other browsers' behavior for this because changing value from zero to non-zero is safer than non-zero to non-zero or zero.  And also next one is for bug 354358.  UI Events declares that "keydown" and "keyup" events represent physical key state and should be fired even during composition.  As far as the reported issues, this behavior is expected mainly by Korean web developers and some web apps depend on the behavior.  Therefore, we need to start to dispatch them during composition.  Finally, for bug 218415, we should enable window.event.  This is declared by the Living DOM Standard.  A lot of web apps depend on window.event and the last blocker, bug 1479964 was fixed so that it is the time to enable this.

|19|Masayuki Nakano |Bug 1496288 - part 1: Make blacklist prefs for keypress event behavior changes ride the train r=smaug  Basically, we shouldn't have blacklist to disable web API.  However, the keypress event behavior changes are not standardized things.  Therefore, if some web developers realize that they need to change their apps when it's too late for them, Firefox users need to use another browser for such web apps for several weeks or more, and such things may make the users switch their default browser.  For avoiding such worst scenario, we should take the blacklists and if we get such compatibility reports, we should add the domains into the blacklist even in release channel.

|10|Blake Kaplan |Bug 1510809 - Fire updatefound correctly for SWC.register r=asuth  Currently, we are required to fire updatefound in three cases:      When a "soft" update finds an update.     When a call to ServiceWorkerRegistration.update finds an update.     When ServiceWorkerContainer.register registers a ServiceWorker.  In the first case, there are no requirements on the timing of the event. For the second two cases, however, the promise returned by update or register needs to resolve before updatefound is dispatched. We hack around the first case by explicitly counting the calls to update and only dispatching updatefound when the final promise resolves. In the case of SWC.register, the ServiceWorkerRegistration object might not even exist when it notices that we need to fire updatefound, which suggests that we need some code to tell it when to fire the event; except that in the soft update case, there is no obvious place to do so. So, the easiest way to resolve this is to have the parent process tell the ServiceWorkerRegistration when to fire updatefound itself. This way, we don't rely on any tricky timing and everything is consistent with itself.

|5|Jan de Mooij |Bug 1508962 part 1 - Add a BaselineCodeGen<Handler> base class to BaselineCompiler and use it for JSOp compilation. r=djvj  This is just the first step: the Handler classes are still empty and BaselineCodeGen contains fields/methods that should eventually move out of there. That will happen in follow-up patches.  Rooting analysis now reported a hazard in ObjectGroup::getOrFixupCopyOnWriteObject, this patch has the trivial fix for that too.

|3|Jason Orendorff |Bug 1391756 - Try to fix rare timeout in dom/tests/mochitest/fetch/test_readableStreams.html. r=baku  Also removes an infinite regress of nested iframes. The original problem was that tests would start running before the child iframe was done loading. The straightforward fix is to have the child frame start the test. But this caused further error messages because the child iframe is loaded more than once; removing the iframe from the iframe fixes this.

|19|Chris Martin <cmartin@mozilla.com>|Bug 1402282 - Change jemalloc to use secure random private arena ids r=glandium  Previously the id for a new arena was just a counter that increased by one every time. For hardening purposes, we want to make private arenas use a secure random ID, so an attacker will have a more difficult time finding the memory they are looking for.

|17|Mike Hommey <mh+mozilla@glandium.org>|Bug 1508547 - Switch Android builds to clang 7 again. r=dmajor  Bug 1492663 upgraded those builds to clang 7, and bug 1503330 brought them back to clang 6 because of speedometer regressions.  With the previous change, the regression doesn't happen any more, allowing to upgrade again.

|14|Aaron Klotz <aklotz@mozilla.com>|Bug 1508468: Convert launcher process to use mozilla::Result for error propagation; r=mhowell  This patch does a couple of things:    I added a new class, |WindowsError| to WinHeaderOnlyUtils. The idea here is   to encapsulate as much of the Windows error gamut as possible into one class.   Since Win32 errors and NTSTATUS codes may both be encoded as HRESULTs, I   used the latter type to store the error. It also contains functions for   converting between the various error code formats, as well as stringification   via FormatMessage.    I added |LauncherError| which also includes file and line number information,   which I believe will be important for launcher process failure diagnostics.   (Instantiation of LauncherErrors obviously must be done via macros to capture   __FILE__ and __LINE__).    I then converted all of the launcher process code (and its few depenencies) to   utilize this new functionality via the new |LauncherResult| type.    If we detect an error in one of the top-level launcher process functions, we   pass it to |HandleLauncherError| for processing. This function currently just   throws up a |MessageBox| like the previous code did, with the intention of   enhancing that further in the future.

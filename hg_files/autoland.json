Instead, if a single string literal is too long, it breaks off a piece and moves it to the next line, which leads to a bunch of choppy short string bits. The resulting string literals are still a bit choppy, mostly because I didn't want to break up the long names of prefs.  Here's an example of what I mean:  |--- max width --- | \"some long string literal\" \"is here but it goes on for multiple lines\"  This gets turned into:  |--- max width --- | \"some long string \" \"literal\" \"is here but it \" \"goes on for multiple lines\"  My patch manually would turn this into:  |--- max width --- | \"some long string \" \"literal is here \" \"but it goes on \" \"for multiple lines\"  The strings in my patch don't always end up at column 80, because the width is set to work with wherever clang format ends up actually indenting them.

The major categories of failures I have noticed in xpcom/ are:  - Comments that are lists. I fixed these by manually getting them so   they'll be within 80 columns after clang-format runs.  - Comments intermixed with lists of things like enums, initializers,   or even fields in a class. It doesn't seem to associate the comment   with the item in the list correctly. The worst cases of these happen   when it changes initializer lists from having commas at the start of   each item to having them at the end. In the initializer comma cases,   I fixed them by making the commas at the end, so clang-format won't   mix things up. For other cases, I often moved the comment for an   item onto its own line, because it was not possible to have both the   comment and the item on the same line and stay within 80 columns.  - One odd case is nsEnumeratorUtils.cpp, where the end of line comment   after a NS_DECL macro confused clang-format and made it stop   realizing that the NS_DECL thing was a complete statement.

Unfortunately, in practice we wind up needing the pid/handle immediately, and this requirement is too deeply embedded in IPC for that to be viable.

Processes aren't registered as blockers until after they launch successfully.  The main goal is to not leak a blocker if launch fails, but we don't need to block  while  launching synchronously, because this all happens on the main thread.  2. Preallocated processes themselves aren't blockers.  The main goal here is so that async preallocation doesn't need extra complexity to avoid being blocked by itself when launch completes.  This mostly doesn't affect actual behavior, because we currently support at most one preallocated process.  The difference is the window from when the process is sent its first PBrowserConstructor until when it's next idle, where there is now no longer a blocker, but this seems to be relatively short (~100ms) and we don't even try to launch a new process until at least 1s + an idle runnable.  This patch does not explicitly RemoveBlocker in ActorDestroy like the first attempt did, because it's unnecessary: this is handled in the ipc:content-shutdown observer.

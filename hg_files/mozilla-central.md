|17|Andrew Swan |Bug 1508664 Avoid importing Extension.jsm too early r=kmag  The test failure from this bug was due to code that reads Services.appinfo running too early before our test code that overrides appinfo got a chance to run.  Addon Manager test code could use a more thorough cleanup pass, but this is a quick-and-dirty fix suitable for uplifting in the short term.

|16|Timothy Guan-tin Chien |Bug 1513600 - Use elementFromPoint() to measure isMouseOverVideo r=jaws  The checkEventWithin method is broken by two bugs:  The first one is bug 1493525 because we ended up pass the proxy instance, instead of the element reference, as the parent node to compare. The second one is unknown and happened sometime after that bug. The \|relatedTarget\| of the mouse event is always <video>, instead of the element within Shadow DOM that the cursor is moving out to.  Instead of identify the second bug in the DOM, this patch employs a simpler fix by using elementFromPoint() to identify the cursor position.

|11|Timothy Guan-tin Chien |Bug 1510848 - Do not unattach UA Widget Shadow Root if the element is already re-attached to the tree r=emilio,smaug  This patch moves all UA Widget calls to helper functions in Element.cpp. The helper function AttachAndSetUAShadowRoot sets the shadow root in a runnable, so that it is in the same order of NotifyUAWidget  runnables.

|10|Jed Davis |Bug 1510934 - Ensure that pref changes during content process launch are delivered to the process. r=njn  Some prefs need to be available before IPC is started, so we serialize a snapshot when we start launching the process, and then stream further changes over IPC messages.  However, async launch introduces a window between the snapshot and when the parent can start sending messages, during which other code can run on the main thread and change prefs.  In order to not lose those updates, they're queued and sent when the launch is complete.  Depends on D14089  Differential Revision: https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D14090|[URL](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/pushloghtml?changeset=74bfa63e922c)|2018-12-14 05:28:56
|9|Jed Davis |Bug 1510934 - Change ContentParent's alive/dead tracking to launching/alive/dead. r=mrbkap  We need content processes that are created but not finished launching (not "alive" yet) to be treated differently from ones that have exited (no longer "alive"), so the boolean mIsAlive is expanded to a 3-state enumeration, which could be expanded more in the future if needed.  (This is similar to GeckoChildProcessHost::mProcessState, but it's synchronized with the rest of the ContentParent's state, which can lag the GeckoChildProcessHost state due to runnable dispatch.)  This patch also removes mIsAvailable/IsAvailable/MarkAsTroubled, which are unused as of bug 1459212.

|6|tossj |Bug 1437258 - Move webRequestBlocking permission check to webRequest child to log error to debugging console. r=mixedpuppy  With this change, ext-webRequest.js will throw an ExtensionError when "blocking" is used without the "webRequestBlocking" permission, and ExtensionParent.jsm will relay that error to ExtensionChild.jsm so an error can be logged to the extension debugging console. Previously, the error was only being logged to the browser console.

    "commit_message": "Bug 1509362 - Don't crash when constructing actor during content shutdown, r=jld  When shutting down a content process, we call `Close` on the `IToplevelProtocol`. This causes the MessageChannel to be `Close`-ed, which in turn sends a `GOODBYE_MESSAGE`: https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/876022232b15425bb9efde189caf747823b39567/ipc/glue/MessageChannel.cpp#2852  This message is intercepted on the I/O thread in the content process, before any code is informed in content, and used to set the `mChannelState` property to `ChannelClosing`: https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/876022232b15425bb9efde189caf747823b39567/ipc/glue/MessageChannel.cpp#1176  Once this state has been set, which is performed as soon as the message is received, whether or not other messages have been processed yet, no messages can be sent back to the parent process. This is usually what causes the 'Too late to send/recv' message spam in the console, as we're still trying to send messages at this time.  Usually this is fine - the message send fails, but we gracefully recover, and the process begins shutting down like normal. Unfortunately, child actor constructors currently have code automatically generated in them which causes a process crash if the send fails. As it's impossible for the main thread to know that the channel has been closed ahead of time (due to this happening out-of-band), we can then cause random content process crashes during shutdown due to actor construction.  Unfortunately, we can't just destroy the actor, as our caller may (and often do) depend on the actor reference they gave us still being valid after calling Send Constructor. Fortunately, if a message send failed, it means we're in the process of being shut down.  This patch handles this by ignoring ctor send errors, and treating them like messages which successfully were queued to send, but got lost due to the other side hanging up. The actor will be gracefully destroyed in DestroySubtree when its manager is destroyed.  Differential Revision: https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D12695 ",

As many of these names are generic (e.g. CreateFile, CreateWindow), they can mess up Gecko code that may legitimately have its own methods with the same names.  The header also defines some traditional SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE defines which can mess up our code by conflicting with local values.
